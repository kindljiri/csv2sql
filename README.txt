Comma separated format is quite easy to generate by script(I ussually do so).
You can also specify other separator than ,(comma), like ; or : which are often
used as separators in linux/unix enviroment. 

As sometimes I face problem to transfere data from excel to SQL DB, make this
script to make my work easier, it doesn't create table for you, but at least it
will help you to fill it.

WARNING: All data are pased as strings for the moment, so some editing of output
needs to be done, before you will run it against DB. 

Enjoy :-)
